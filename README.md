### Hi there, I'm Fabien ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer but with full-stack knowledge. 

I'm mostly working with VueJS ecosystem for the front-end part and with a nodeJS/ExpressJS stack when i need an API.

I read somewhere that "You Die When You Stop Learning", this quote motivates me to learn and be better everyday.
